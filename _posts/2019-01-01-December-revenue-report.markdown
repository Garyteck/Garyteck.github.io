## [ Top 1 : Envestio surprising return]({{envestio.affiliate_link}})

In Late November, I followed the advice of Jørgen Wolf of [financially free](https://www.financiallyfree.com) and invested 800 € in Envestio.
Envestio is a crowdfunding platform that focus on loan to companies. I have invested in two projects, financing the operation of a fruit-wholesaler (20,55% interest) and financing a park of wind turbine (16 % interest).

I really like Envestio because it offers high interest rate and loans have a buy-back guarantee. Which means, if a borrower defaults, I will get my investment and interest after a recovery period. This is a good insurance.

Let's say you [register on Envestio]({{envestio.affiliate_link}}) and invest 500 € in a 9 months project with 17 % interest. When you make a deposit, you get 5 € the morning after PLUS +0.5% interest on your investment.


| Month| Without referral link | With referral link |
| ------ | :-----------: |----------:|
| 0 month   | 500 € | 505 € |
| 1 month   | 507 € | 512 € |
| 2 month   | 514 € | 519 € |
| ...   | .. |.. |
| 9 month   | 567 € | 573 € |

In December, I have already made **18 € in interest**. [By registering with this]({{envestio.affiliate_link}}), you can expect ***+1.2% € more on your return on investment. Not bad !***

## [Top 2 : Fast Invest, solid return]({{fast_invest.affiliate_link}})

I was attracted by FastInvest because it was one of the few peer to peer lending platform that offered investment in loans with than 15% interest.
I decided to go all in and invest 1000 €.The majority of the loans I invested in, have a 15 % interest. Then I have 13.5% and 10% interest loans.

I am very happy to see that this was a good decision, in december I have already **received 10.84 € in interest**. Fast Invest works really fine.


Fast Invest is not suitable for short-term investors, but I think it offers the best loans for long-term investors. They do not have a referral program but their return on invesment are already very good.  
You can register and start investing on their [website]({{fast_invest.affiliate_link}})


## [Top 3 : Mintos, good return]({{mintos.affiliate_link}})

Mintos was the first peer to peer lending platform I used. It is good, simple to use and has been there for a long time. This is the most known crowdlending platform. It has many loans so your money will not be standing idle, it will be invested quick.

I have deposited 990 € since I started investing in June 2018. My strategy on Mintos was to invest in very short-term loans and re-invest all the interests.

The strategy is paying off because this december I made **8.75 € in interest .**

Mintos is a really good platform, many loans have more than 13 % interest. There is a way to increase your profit

Let's say you send 500 € to your account. Then you decide to invest in a medium term loan of 3 month with 12% interest. [If you register with this link]({{mintos.affiliate_link}}), in 30 days you will get +1% on the money you send on your mintos account, then in 60 and 90 days, you will get 1%
on the money you invested.


| Days| Without referral link | With referral link |
| ------ | :-----------: |----------:|
| 14 days   | 500 € | 500 € |
| 30 days referral reward   |  | +5 € |
| 44 days  | 502 € | 502 € |
| 60 days referral reward   |  | +5 € |
| 74 days   | 512 € | 512 € |
| 90 days referral reward   |  | +5 € |
| Total   | 512 € | 527 € |

[By registering with this link]({{mintos.affiliate_link}}), you can expect ***+3% more on your return on investment. This is really good!***

## [Top 4 : Twino, can do better]({{twino.affiliate_link}})

Now the very last, Twino. This was the second peer-to-peer lending platform I have invested in. Unlike my Mintos investment, I started with a 750 € invesment in July. Then the cash drag happened. My loans were staying idle for a too long period.

In mid November, I realize that loans were finding borrowers more quickly and the internal rate of return was increasing. This month, **I made 3.93 € in profit.**

# Conclusion

This Month I have **made 41.72 € in interest**. I did not imagine making that much when starting p2p lending. I cannot wait to see how much money I will make in January 2019. Stay tuned !!
