Renting your apartment on Airbnb is a good way to make extra money. Here is what I did before opening the doors of my apartments to guests. You can follow this recipe and start earning money while on holidays.

### 1. Clean your apartment

Your guests expect a clean apartment. The bear minimum is
* Empty and clean the fridge
* Change the bedcovers and bedsheets
* Clean the bathroom
* Remove dust, Clean windows







### 2. List your apartment on Airbnb website

This is what my apartment looks like on Airbnb.

  <script async="" src="https://www.airbnb.com/embeddable/airbnb_jssdk"></script>
</div>

### 3. List the amenities of your apartment

Is there an internet connection ?
Will the guest be able to cook in your kitchen ?
Is it an extra bed for additional guests or for a baby ?

My apartment is suited for families with small babies. I also make it possible for my guests to cook at home.

### 4. Keep your apartment availability calendar up to date

You do not want to miss out on possible revenue. Your apartment should be listed on the website if it is available.
As soon as I know my holiday dates , I update my apartment availability on the website. The sooner the better.

### 5. (Optional) Find a co-host to manage the apartment

If you have multiple guests booking your apartment while you are away, you will need a co-host. The co-host will manage the check-in and check-out of your guest. He will hand-in the keys of your apartment and communicate with your guest.

### 6. Write a house manual (dos and don'ts of your apartment)

It is a good thing to keep the house manual in paper form in the apartment. Give some guidances on how to use some tools, what not to do in the apartment.

### Conclusion

It was a good experience renting my apartment during my holidays. [I invite you to do the same](https://www.airbnb.com/r/gpierrelouis1)
