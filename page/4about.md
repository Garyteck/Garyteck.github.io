## About me

My name is Gary Pierre-Louis, I live in Denmark, with my girlfriend and our daughter. I want to build a strong financial safety net. A safety net that will enable me to stop working forever or to spend my time on whatever hobby-side-project I want, no matter if it is profitable or not.

### Introducing Financial Independence

> [Financial independence ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_independence) means you have enough wealth to live on without working. Financially independent people have assets that **generate income** (cash flow) that is at least equal to their **expenses**.


I must have a tight control of my expenses. I am quite critical of our consumer society and I will happily live with fewer stuffs.
But no matter how much I reduce, there are many expenses that must be paid for.

### My starting portfolio

At the beginning of this journey, my only asset was the apartment I owned. I had to get into debt to buy it, but this is the only debt I owe. [See me current portfolio]({{site.url}}/portfolio)

### My FI strategy

I will focus on assets that generate income ( shares and lending ). I will never try to time the market , I will have a long term strategy.
