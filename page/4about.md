My name is Gary Pierre-Louis, I live in Denmark, with my girlfriend and our daughter. I want to build a strong financial safety net. A safety net that will enable me to stop working forever or to spend my time on whatever hobby-side-project I want, no matter if it is profitable or not.

### Introducing Financial Independence

> [Financial independence ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_independence) means you have enough wealth to live on without working. Financially independent people have assets that **generate income** (cash flow) that is at least equal to their **expenses**.

## Budgeting : controlling my expenses

I must have a tight control of my expenses. I have always been frugal, but no matter how much I reduce, there are expenses that must be paid for. [See how my family is budgeting.]({{site.url}}/budget)

## My starting portfolio

At the beginning of this journey, my only asset was the apartment I owned. I had to get into debt to buy it, but this is the only debt I owe.
I also have an emergency fund of 5500 € in a bank account that offers 5% interest on the first 6600 € [See me current portfolio.]({{site.url}}/portfolio)

## FI Strategy

Every month, I will buy assets that generate income. I am young, I will be quite aggressive but take reasonable risk. Eventually those assets will match my expenses and I will be financially independent. [If you are curious you can take a look at my revenue report.]({{site.url}}/category/#Revenue report)

**What is your strategy ? What would you do differently ?**
