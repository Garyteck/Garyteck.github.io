## What is peer-to-peer p2plending ?

When one needs money, one borrows money to the bank. The bank makes a profit by demanding the money back plus some interest more. With p2plending, there is no bank involved, only lenders, borrowers and a website.


The peer-to-peer lending website is a marketplace where lenders and borrowers meet. The borrowers ask for money and say when they will pay it back. All the demand for money are listed as loans that need investments. When you invest in a loan, you will get your investment ( the principal ) plus some interest.

The p2plending platform and you will get the interest, not the bank.

## How much does it cost ?

All operations are free. You can register, deposit your money, invest in a loan and withdraw your profit for free.

## Is crowdlending the same as p2plending ?

In Crowdlending, companies ask for money. They usually need a lot of money so there is more money in a single loan. They also give more information on what the money will be used for. Loans to companies are usually riskier so they come with a higher interest rate. More money for you, the investor :)

## How much can I earn ?

Most p2p lending website say they have an average return of more than 10% per year. In practice, many platform experience a cash drag : there is too much lenders but too little borrowers. In order to not let your money staying idle, you should use different platform [just like me]( {{site.baseurl }}/portfolio)

By using the registration link bonus on the website, you will get higher returns on your investment.

## Investment is risky , how can I lower the risk ?

Diversification is the key. Invest your money in different loans, on different brokers and different regions etc...
